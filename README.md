# NotesApp in Angular

This is my first app in Angular during which development I got familiat with component building, routing in Angular, event binding, reactive forms etc.

Thank You for stopping by.

## Demo

https://bedicooper.github.io/notes-app/

## What's inside?
The app consists of a round Add button that takes you to the form to add a new note, and a list of notes that will appear beneath the button.
You can click on the note to go to its details page. So far there is no new information there, but You can delete the note form its details page.

## What's comming?
In the next version I would like to add localStorage persistence to notes as now they disappear on page reload.
